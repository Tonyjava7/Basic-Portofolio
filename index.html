			<p>I am an American from Korean descent. I was born in S. Korea and immigrated to the U.S., Hawaii to be more specific, when I was 8 years old. SOUTH Korea, not NORTH.  There's a difference in case you haven't followed the news with the banter between President Trump and the "Dear Leader".</p>
			<br>
			<p id="2Paboutme">
			I like traveling, long walks on the beach, and sipping on margaritas.  Wait, that sounds like a bio from eHarmony.  Scratch that. 
			<!--use CSS to strike through the prior 3 sentences. "text-decoration:line-through"-->

			<p>
			I love my wife (Sharon), son (Oraiah), and daughter (Abigail). I am hooked on seeking truth, wisdom as well as knowledge, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Tap, Snap, or Nap.
